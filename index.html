It ticks all the boxes with warming spices, ginger and a rich gravy that coats the chicken pieces. There are so many memories of eating this on a Sunday afternoon at my home when I lived in India. </p></div>

		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m2">Punjabi Dal Makhani</mark><br><br><br>Everybody loves a basic tadka Dal as part of an Indian meal. A bowl of warm dal, rice topped with ghee is comfort food and even makes a perfect accompaniment to any meal. But when we think of slow cooked creamy Dal Makhani it’s in a league of its own. A traditional lentil dish that’s part of most Indian meals at weddings and special occasions.</p></div>
		

		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m3">Punjabi Matar Paneer</mark><br><br><br>Renowned for its vegetarian cuisine, the Indian subcontinent has a massive population that relies purely on a meat free diet. From home cooked curries, street food, snacks and restaurant meals the variety is endless. Sheer abundance of lentils, beans and seasonal vegetables alongside an array of spices to lift the flavours of these ingredients makes it a viable diet and also one that is universally considered to be one of the best cuisines to offer a sustainable vegetarian meal.</p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m4">Gobi ke Paranthe</mark><br><br><br>Unleavened Indian bread is cooked across households in India and commonly eaten for breakfast as well apart from any other times of the day. There are lots of recipes for parathas including a variation of fillings that they can be made with. My favourite is with spiced potatoes and also paneer/ Indian cottage cheese. Both of which I cook regularly.</p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m5">Lucknowi Gobi Aloo ki Tahiri</mark><br><br><br>Tahiri; a traditional rice based dish hailing from Uttar Pradesh, brings just that to my table for an evening meal. Chunks of potato, cauliflower and rice are fried in butter, whole garam masala and chilli. Cooked in a large pot the smells are wafting through my kitchen. Tahiri can be made with meat as well although I think a celebration of vegetables with ghee or butter and fluffy rice grains makes each mouthful so delectable. </p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m6">Khatte Chole</mark><br><br><br>An Indian breakfast in my mind is always worth waking up in the mornings for. So later in the year during my trip to Mumbai I found myself devouring into Khatte Chole; lightly spiced chickpea curry with delicious bhaturas/ Indian fried bread. This home style tangy stew like dish was cooked at my friends place with piping hot bhaturas. </p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m7">Tandoori Fish Tikka</mark><br><br><br>One of the most common dishes at seafood restaurants across Mumbai will always include Tandoori Pomfret. Pomfret was the preferred choice fish when I grew in the city. A flat fish, delicate and flaky which takes to the marinade and charred smokey tandoor flavours  really well.Buying pomfret was always a luxury (for us at least!) not just was it expensive but the prized centre piece at dinner parties when used in curries and pan fried with masala.</p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m8">Kalakhand</mark><br><br><br>It has a soft crumbly milk cake consistency made from reduced thickened milk. Traditionally the barfi can also be made with khoya (mawa) thickened reduced milk solids used for a lot of Indian sweets. It takes a while to reduce the milk to get the resultant khoya mix so to speed things up I’m making it this year with fresh paneer. I always stock some either homemade or from my local farm shop so grating it to make Kalakand is a breeze.</p></div>


		<div class="col-des-3 col-tab-6"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark class="m9">Mango Barfi</mark><br><br><br>Mango season in our home was a feast and still is. From milkshakes, to aamras, kulfi, falooda and of course just sliced too. Its a pleasure to devour into something that is so gorgeously sweet and addictive. One of my favourite sweets is barfi and infused with fresh mango puree makes it so very delicious. This recipe is a cheats method of getting the same barfi results for something that would probably take much longer to make and set.</p></div>

I intend on doing that and much more this year to revel in the excitement of the festival I so associate with my childhood. This week there are candles & diyas lit in my home and sweets galore but to make it that tad bit special I’m also doing little food hampers for some close friends. I have made a grated raw mango chutney in little jars.</p></div>
